# Running ibc-go e2e tests

This repo holds a sample workflow demonstrating how to run the e2e tests in the [ibc-go](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go) repo
with arbitrary chain images and tags in CI.

See [this example](./.github/workflows/run-ibc-go-e2e.yml) as an example of how to run these tests in CI.
